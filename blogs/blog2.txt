Avoiding Burnout: Practical Steps for High Performers

Burnout happens when prolonged stress meets insufficient recovery and meaning. High performers avoid burnout by:
- Saying no and creating boundaries.
- Scheduling deliberate recovery (weekends, offline time).
- Diversifying activities: mixing hard cognitive work with lower-effort activities.
- Seeking social support and mentorship.
- Regularly reflecting on goals and adjusting workload.
