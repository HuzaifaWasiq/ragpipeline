Energy Mastery: What it is and how to build it

Energy mastery is the practice of managing your physical, mental, and emotional energy so you can perform at your best regularly.
High performers treat energy as a renewable resource: they build routines (sleep, nutrition, movement), create recovery habits, and use rituals to enter focused states.
Key tips:
- Prioritize sleep and short movement breaks.
- Use time-blocking to protect deep-work periods.
- Practice micro-recovery (short walks, breathing) during long work sessions.
- Track energy, not just timeâ€”note when you feel best and schedule important work then.
